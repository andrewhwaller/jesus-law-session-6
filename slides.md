# Ritual impurity
1. Unavoidable, sometimes natural, and part of everyday life.
2. Can be contracted from objects or substances.
3. Can be transmitted to others directly and indirectly.
4. Removed by time, ritual washing, and sometimes sacrifice.
5. ***Not*** sinful! It is not a sin to become ritually impure.

# Demons in early Jewish literature
* *Genesis Apocryphon*: Abraham casts out demons that afflict Pharaoh
* *1 Enoch*: Demons are the wandering spirits of the Nephilim, descendants of the fallen angels
* *Jubilees*: Demons influence Noah's offspring after the flood
* 11Q5 19.13--16: “Forgive my sin, YHWH, and cleanse me from my iniquity. Bestow on me a spirit of faith and knowledge. Let me not stumble in transgression. Let not Satan rule over me, nor an evil spirit; let neither pain nor evil purpose take possession of my bones.”

# Numbers 19:14--20
This is the law when someone dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, shall be \[impure\] seven days. And every open vessel with no cover fastened on it is \[impure\]. Whoever in the open field touches one who has been killed by a sword, or who has died naturally, or a human bone, or a grave, shall be \[impure\] seven days. For the \[impure\] they shall take some ashes of the burnt purification offering, and running water shall be added in a vessel; then a pure person shall take hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, on all the furnishings, on the persons who were there, and on whoever touched the bone, the slain, the corpse, or the grave. The \[pure\] person shall sprinkle the \[impure\] ones on the third day and on the seventh day, thus purifying them on the seventh day. Then they shall wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and at evening they shall be \[pure\]. Any who are \[impure\] but do not purify themselves, those persons shall be cut off from the assembly, for they have defiled the sanctuary of the <sc>Lord</sc>. Since the water for \[purification\] has not been dashed on them, they are \[impure\].
